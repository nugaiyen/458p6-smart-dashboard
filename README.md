I used AI in this project to debug, explain c3 and d3, explain why my [bottom:10px;] did not work for the chart background. I did not use AI to write or complete any components where AI use is prohibited. I can explain the relevent codes and the reasoning behind them. <br> <Br> 
For this project, I used two datasets: <a href ="https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b4a142f592e94d39a3bf787f3c112c1d_0/explore?location=47.614610%2C-122.336918%2C11" target="_blank"><strong>Neighborhood Atlas Map</strong> </a> and <a href="https://home.urbanlogiq.us/public/sdot-crash-analysis?c=47.9133696%2C-122.241024&z=11" target="_blank"><strong>Crash Analysis.</strong> </a>

Using Google Colab, I cleaned both datasets, formatted coordinates, and then combined them through a spatial join. This linked each collision to its neighborhood, enabling analysis of collision patterns across Seattle.
